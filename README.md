# Lowering-The-Frequency-Of-Mass-Shootings-By-Increasing-Ammunition-Taxes-A-Mathematical-Approach
In the words of the late New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ”Guns don’t kill people; bullets do...It is time the Federal Government began taxing handgun ammunition used in crime out of existence”.  While on its face, the idea of increasing the tax on ammunition might seem novel, this notion has seen its fair share of attention on the senate floor.In 1993 the New York Times reported on Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, saying that he would insistthat President Clinton’s health-care plan include a huge increase in Federal taxes on handgun ammunition that would make some especially destructive bullets unaffordable. As one would imagine, this idea was simply disregarded as being quixotic. But seeing that this is coming from the chairman of the Finance Committee, one of the two Senate committees with a predominant role on the health bill, a proposal to tax ammunition immediately becomes a serious issue. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical analysis of NY senator Moynihan’s potential third solution.
